# This is a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) site powered by a [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io) backend.

This is a website for my monday night DnD group, the Monday Night Murderhobos. I wanted to create a hub for everything that happens in our sessions so we have
a log that's easy to reference and read.

This was generated by using [this](https://github.com/sanity-io/example-company-website-gatsby-sanity-combo) awesome gatsby-starter project built by
the guys over at Sanity.io! It's brand new stuff, and is a work in progress.
